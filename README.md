# Michel Interaction Classification with CNN on LArTPC Images
Convolutional Neural Network made as a part of Directed Research Program

## Overview
This project focuses on building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) images of Michel electron interactions. The model distinguishes between:

Stop: An interaction is present (Michel electron).

Thru: No interaction present (particle passes through).

## Objective
Accurately identify Michel electron interactions in LArTPC images to support downstream tasks in neutrino experiments, such as energy calibration and event reconstruction.

## Methodology
**Data Preparation:** Preprocessed and labeled LArTPC images into stop and thru categories.

**Model Design:** Built a CNN optimized for binary classification of 2D detector images.

**Training & Evaluation:** Trained the model and evaluated its performance using standard metrics
